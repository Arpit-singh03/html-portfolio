<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm [Arpit singh], a passionate and driven fullstack web developer eager to build innovative and efficient web applications. I have a solid foundation in both frontend and backend technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and popular frameworks and libraries like React and Node.js.</p>

<p>I love crafting clean, user-friendly interfaces and writing scalable backend code. Though I'm new to the professional scene, I'm continuously learning and improving my skills by working on personal projects and collaborating with fellow developers.

My goal is to create impactful web experiences that are both visually appealing and functionally robust. I am excited to contribute my skills, solve challenging problems, and grow as a developer in a dynamic team environment.</p>

<p>Let me know if you'd like me to tailor it more personally or add specific technologies you want to highlight.</p>
